### **Lite Presets.**

Lite presets use the "MBZ__3__STD__GDV-MINI.slangp" or the "MBZ__3__STD__LCD-GRID.slangp" base preset. These presets share the full feature set of the Mega Bezel shader framework.

The "MBZ__3" designation places them 4th on the list for PC requirements, the GDV-MINI CRT shader has less features and lower requirements than the CRT shader in the Standard presets.
