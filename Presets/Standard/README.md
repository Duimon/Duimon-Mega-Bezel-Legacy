### **Standard Presets.**

Lite presets use the "MBZ__3__STD__GDV.slangp" or the "MBZ__3__STD__LCD-GRID.slangp" base preset. These presets share the full feature set of the Mega Bezel shader framework.

The "MBZ__3" designation places them 4th on the list for PC requirements, the GDV CRT shader is much newer, has many more features, and higher PC requirements than the MINI shader in the Lite presets.
